# speaker-challenge
Speak in front of the community. Enhance your credentials. All help provided here.

If you're part of #teamtanay community then you win a book as well. Just something to motivate my students. :)

Hello! 

## motivation
One way to get recognition in industry is to speak in tech events. I attended the Discord Live today and it's heartening to see such amazing speakers amongst us. 

See, I can't give you money to motivate you. But here's another challenge open for all of you. 

## challenge 

Speak in one of the community events. ReactJS Bangalore, JSMeetup, etc. I know the organisers, they're helpful to get new people in. You don't have to speak for 30-40 minutes. Prepare a small 10 minutes talk on any topic you like (related to engineering/dev). Prepare 10 slides and apply to speak. 

## prize

1.  Everyone who goes from #teamtanay to speak, I'll make sure that you get maximum visibility on social media.
1. I'll sponsor one book (yet to decide) as a token of appreciation for you. 

## you need help

* I'm ready to help. 
   You need to come up with a topic and get the slides ready. Before applying, I'll review it with you. I'm going to help 2-3 students every month. This will make you ready to be an industry leader someday. 

* If we get more participation, I will involve other mentors to help you too, but let's get you started.

* As a practice session, you can present inside the Discord community with all of us and get some QnAs.

## rules

- Nothing, you need to take the lead. 
- When presenting, as a courtesy, I expect you to thank the community which has helped you getting started.
