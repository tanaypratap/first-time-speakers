# speaker-challenge
Speak in front of the community. Enhance your credentials. All help provided here.

If you're part of #teamtanay community then you win a book as well. Just something to motivate my students. :)

Hello! 

## motivation
One way to get recognition in industry is to speak in tech events. I attended the Discord Live today and it's heartening to see such amazing speakers amongst us. 

See, I can't give you money to motivate you. But here's another challenge open for all of you. 

## challenge 

Speak in one of the community events. ReactJS Bangalore, JSMeetup, etc. I know the organisers, they're helpful to get new people in. You don't have to speak for 30-40 minutes. Prepare a small 10 minutes talk on any topic you like (related to engineering/dev). Prepare 10 slides and apply to speak. 

## prize

1.  Everyone who goes from #teamtanay to speak, I'll make sure that you get maximum visibility on social media.
1. I'll sponsor one book (yet to decide) as a token of appreciation for you. 

## you need help

* I'm ready to help. 
   You need to come up with a topic and get the slides ready. Before applying, I'll review it with you. I'm going to help 2-3 students every month. This will make you ready to be an industry leader someday. 

* If we get more participation, I will involve other mentors to help you too, but let's get you started.

* As a practice session, you can present inside the Discord community with all of us and get some QnAs.

## rules

- Nothing, you need to take the lead. 
- When presenting, as a courtesy, I expect you to thank the community which has helped you getting started.

## how to do you benefit by speaking out?

### communication
Communication is key in any job, even as engineers we need to talk to our team members. When foreign companies want to hire you they can see your code, read your blog, but how do they know that you are fluent in English? Your talks recorded on YT helps with this..

### jobs
See you can get all the startup jobs here with jobChallenge. 
But if you want to go to Europe/Canada/Australia/Aisa etc. you have to start speaking in community.
I don't ask you to waste your time which won't be helpful in the long run
I just want you all to start early. Right now you can take all pressure. So push yourself more.
